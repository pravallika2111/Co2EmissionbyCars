# Co2EmissionusingML

**Abstract**
> In most developing countries, the increasing rate of Carbon emissions is considered a major cause of concern. India is leading in terms of CO2 emissions as compared to other countries. The study used descriptive methods. It focuses on finding the main potential parameters that affect the concentration of CO2 emissions based on energy resources. To get predictions here machine learning algorithms will be applied.

**Introduction**
> Machine learning algorithms offer several advantages for CO2 emission prediction. They can handle large and complex datasets, capture non-linear relationships between variables, and adapt to changing patterns over time. Moreover, they can incorporate various data sources, including historical emission data, meteorological information, energy consumption data, population statistics, and more, to improve the accuracy of predictions.

**OBJECTIVES**
> To predict the carbon dioxide emissions using the ML model.
> To identify the features that are causing more carbon dioxide emissions.
> To reduce their usage in the future.

**FEATURES AND FUNCTIONALITIES**
> The features and functionalities of CO2 emission prediction using machine learning can vary depending on the specific implementation and goals of the project. However, machine learning often incorporates some common features and functionalities into CO2 emission prediction systems.
