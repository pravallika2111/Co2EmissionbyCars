# Co2EmissionbyCars

#Abstract
In most of the developing countries, the increasing rate of Carbon
emissions is considered as a major cause of concern. India is leading in terms of
CO2 emissions as compared to other countries.The study used descriptive
methods. It focuses on finding the main potential parameters that affect the
concentration of CO2 emissions based on energy resources. To get predictions
here machine learning algorithms will be applied.

#Introduction
Machine learning algorithms offer several advantages for CO2 emission
prediction. They can handle large and complex datasets, capture non-linear
relationships between variables, and adapt to changing patterns over time.
Moreover, they can incorporate various data sources, including historical
emission data, meteorological information, energy consumption data,
population statistics, and more, to improve the accuracy of predictions.

OBJECTIVES
> To predict the carbon dioxide emissions using ML model.
> To identify the features that are causing more carbon dioxide emissions.
> To reduce their usage in future.
